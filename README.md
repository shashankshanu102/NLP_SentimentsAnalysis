# NLP_SentimentsAnalysis
**Problem Statement:** Find what are the most Customer customer concern areas and also find Sentiments of the people's.


**Introduction**
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a 
business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. However, analysis of
social media streams is usually restricted to just basic sentiment analysis and count based metrics. This is akin to just scratching the 
surface and missing out on those high value insights that are waiting to be discovered. So what should a brand do to capture that low 
hanging fruit?
With the recent advances in deep learning, the ability of algorithms to analyse text has improved considerably. Creative use of advanced artificial intelligence techniques can be an effective tool for doing in-depth research. We believe it is important to classify incoming customer conversation about a brand based on following lines:
- 1) Key aspects of a brand’s product and service that customers care about.
- 2) Users’ underlying intentions and reactions concerning those aspects.
These basic concepts when used in combination, become a very important tool for analyzing millions of brand conversations with human level 
accuracy. In the post, we take the example of Uber and demonstrate how this works. 

**Some of the steps performed are as follows:**

- 1.	Text Cleaning:
      - i) Normalizing case
      - ii) Tokenization
      - iii) Removal of stopwords and punctuations
      - iv) Stemmimg and Lemmatization
      
- 2.	Plot a bigram bar graph on the top words 25 stopwords
- 3.	Find customer concern areas - the top 25 bigrams which includes the below negative words indicating the customer concern areas
 'poor', 'waste', 'bad', 'defective', 'disgusting', 'untrusty', 'worst', 'horrible', 'unexpectedly', 'slow'
- 4.	Plot a bar graph for the top 25 customer concern areas
- 5.	Plot a bar graph for the top 25 customer concern areas?

**Conclusion:**

The age of getting meaningful insights from social media data has now arrived with the advance in technology. Companies have been 
leveraging the power of data lately, but to get the deepest of the information, you have to leverage the power of AI, Deep learning and 
intelligent classifiers like Sentiment Analysis.
